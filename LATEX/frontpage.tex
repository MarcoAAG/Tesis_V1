  \textbf{\large Abstract}
\end{center}
A gimbal system is used for many purposes, such as military, civil, professional task and provide several solutions to actual problems. Since UAV has become in a powerful tool to inertial navigation the study of a stabilizer control of a 2DOF gimbal has increased recently, this is the reason of this thesis.\\
The first step a mathematical model of a 2DOF Gimbal is described to analyse the cinematic and dynamic government equations obtained by Newton-Euler approach. \\
In the second part, a stabilizer controller is design, likewise has been implemented in MATLAB and its performances has been investigated.\\
Finally, the las part of this study, detection of figures has been implemented through artificial vision to get the better approach to a 	Film and video purpose.
